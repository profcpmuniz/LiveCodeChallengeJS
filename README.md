# The Challenge!!!!

Resolve the challenge in the picture however we want to see the result in a web page.

The Acceptance Criteria:

The result of the challenge (sum of the array) must be presented when the index.html page is presented.

Would be interesting to be in a H1 but you can also use the console.log...


```sh
$ pip3 install flask && python3 server.py
```

- You can create as many HTML files as you want
- You can also create CSS files and import them into your website using a `<link>` tag placed between the `<head></head>` tags, like this:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  ...
</head>
```
